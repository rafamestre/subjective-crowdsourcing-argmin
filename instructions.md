# Instructions

The following are the instructions provided to the crowdworkers, in both open and in-house workforce



### Overview

This job is designed to help us understand how arguments are built. In this job you will be presented with two sentences extracted from a debate, which might or might not be related to one another. You will be asked to identify the type of relation between the sentences (e.g. if one sentence supports or attacks the other sentence).

### Guide

You will be presented with two sentences extracted from a US presidential debate, as well as the topic of the discussion.
Then, you will be presented with the context surrounding these sentences (the previous and past interactions of debaters, so you can get an idea of the overall conversation). You should read this passage to give you the context of the sentences you are considering.
To complete this task you will be asked to classify the relation between two sentences, as described in the steps below.
Finally, you will rank your confidence classifying these relations, from 1 to 5.
Note: you won't be penalised for selecting a low confidence score. 

### Steps

Firstly, you will be asked to classify if these sentences are arguments supporting or attacking each other. When the relation is classified as "Support", one of the sentences should provide a reason supporting the claim in the paired sentence. When a relation is classified as "Attack", one of the sentences should provide a reason that attacks or questions the claim made in the paired sentence. You can ask yourself the question: "can I use the information from one of the sentences to support or attack the claim in other one?". If you think that the relation is neither of "Support" nor "Attack", because the sentences are not really claims or arguments, you should select the option "Neither". 

Note: you are not asked to evaluate the quality of the argument, e.g. whether you believe the reason is sufficient to attack or support. If, for instance, one sentence attacks another, but you believe it's not a very good argument, you should still select "Attack".  

One useful way to identify "Support" is to try to link the sentences with "because" or "therefore" or "so", as you would do in a normal conversation. If there is coherence in your construction, it is likely that the sentences are supporting one another. Likewise, to identify "Attack", it's useful to link them with "however" or "but" and see if they make sense. Note that this is not an exact rule and it will depend on the context; remember that, to provide a support or attack argument, one sentence should be able to be interpreted as a reason that supports or attacks the claim of the other sentence. 

### Examples:

Sentence 1	Sentence 2	Relation	Reason
Governments should invest in nuclear energy.	Nuclear energy is very efficient.	Support	One sentence gives a reason why governments should invest in nuclear energy. "Governments should invest in nuclear energy, [because] nuclear energy is very efficient".
Governments should invest in nuclear energy.	Nuclear plants can cause nuclear disasters.	Attack	One sentence gives a reason why governments should not invest in nuclear energy. "Governments should invest in nuclear energy. [However,] nuclear plants can cause nuclear disasters". That's a reason not to invest in nuclear energy.
Governments should invest in nuclear energy.	I think cats are really good pets.	Neither	The second sentence neither supports nor attacks the first - in this case, it's simply because they are talking about different topics. If you try to link the sentences with "because" or "therefore" or "however", it would make no sense.


Some other examples might not be so straightforward, and you might need to consider the context provided around the discussion:

Sentence 1	Sentence 2	Relation	Reason
This policy is helping tons of people.	What they did was illegal.	Attack	Without context, you might think that the sentences are completely unrelated. However, perhaps you learn by reading the context of the discussion that the policy makers did something illegal while presenting it as helping people. Then the sentences are attacking each other: "the policy is helping tons of people, [however] what they did was illegal". Some inference is necessary to reach this conclusion, and knowing the context is necessary.
Donald Trump would be an excellent president.	Billionaires don't have the best interest of people in mind.	Attack	Here, it might seem that both sentences are talking about unrelated things. However, you might know that Trump is a billionaire, and being a president means having the interest of people in mind. Therefore, with the benefit of your own knowledge you can classify the sentences to be attacking one another. The second sentence gives you a reason as to why it is an attack.
Donald Trump would be an excellent president.
Billionaires are natural born leaders.	Support
Likewise, these sentences are clearly supporting each other and you would only know this from the context.


It's important not to confuse coherence with "Support". For instance:

Sentence 1	Sentence 2	Relation	Reason
He talks about the confidence in the American people.	He talks about that movement of Americans that's grown stronger in the last years.	Neither
Both of these sentences are clearly related and they could be part of the same speech. However, we should not confuse coherence with support. None of the sentences are providing an argument, they simply present observations.


It's also very important to notice that you should focus on the Support/Attack relations between the statements, not the topic. For instance:

Sentence 1	Sentence 2	Relation	Reason
He is such a horrible person.	He's hurt many people in his life.	Support
It might seem very clear that these sentences are attacking something. However, they are not a attacking one another in this context. Both of them are attacking a person, but they are supporting one another. It might help you to form the following sentence: "He is a horrible person, [because] he's hurt many people in his life". The second sentence is a supporting argument giving a reason for why he is a horrible person.


Finally, you might come across examples like the following ones:

Sentence 1	Sentence 2	Relation	Reason
Governments should invest in nuclear energy.
That is not true.	Neither
Both sentences are showing neither support nor attack. Although the second sentence looks like a clear attack, it's not providing any reasons, so it's not really an argument.
Governments should invest in nuclear energy.	Thank you.	Neither
Small generic phrases like "No", "You're right", "Thank you"...  are not argumentative units. However, bear in mind that sometimes a one- or two-word sentence might bear full meaning and be used to support or attack another sentence.
It's almost impossible to run all this distance in less than an hour.
I did.
Attack
This very short sentence might be considered meaningless by itself. However, in its context and paired with the first sentence, it provides an "argument by example", attacking the first sentence. 


### Tips
The support or attack relation might be very obvious in some cases, but in others it might be weak or require some previous knowledge for easier classification. This usually happens in cases where several sentences are used to build an argument to become stronger. In these cases, don't be afraid to use the context or your own knowledge to answer these questions, do not rely only on the surface meaning of the sentences.
Remember a very simple rule to identify "Support": link the sentences with connectors like "therefore" or "because" (sometimes, changing the order of the sentences). Likewise, for "Attack", using "however" or "but" can help you. This trick is not 100% accurate, so remember to focus on finding if they provide a reason.
Some of these sentences might be from dialogues between two people in a debate, but others might come from a single speech from the same person. This doesn't mean these sentences should support or attack one another by default.
Select "Neither" if you just don't have enough information to answer, even with the context provided. This can happen if one of the sentences is incomplete and you cannot understand its meaning (e.g. in an interruption), or there are transcription labels. 
Feel free to comment on why you chose a relation, especially if you chose "neither" or you had reasonable doubt.
If you're unsure of the relationship (e.g. because the context is insufficient or the pair of sentences are too subjective), select the one (Support/Attack/Neither) that you believe to be the closest one and a low confidence score. Remember you will not be penalised by selecting a low confidence score.
This will look harder in the beginning, but the work should become faster as you develop your experience of doing the tasks.
This job is designed so that you spend at least 20-30 s in average per task.

### Further information

This task is part of a non-profit University research project aiming at understanding how arguments are built in debates and conversations. 

We are committed to offering a fair price per judgement in our tasks, so we kindly ask you to answer the voluntary satisfaction survey at the end of the task to let us know your opinion about the easiness of the task, the clarity of the instructions or the overall pay. This information will have an impact in the next launches of our project.

Feel free to use the "Explain your answer" text box to let us know about the rationale behind your answers, and other doubts or complains you might have, e.g. were the questions confusing? Were the instructions not clear? Was the context too large or too small? 

Thank you for your collaboration.
